# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
See the consequtive numbers of the same parity as one number:
```
[2, 3, 6, 1, 9, 2] to [2, 3, 6, 10, 2]
```
Because if we want to change the parity at `nums[4] = 9`, we can change at `nums[3] = 1` with more score.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Calculate the sum of consequtive numbers of the same parity. Only need to update the score when the parity changed, and update the score with this sum.

The score is the max of:
```
previous score of same parity + sequence sum,
previous score of different parity + sequence sum - penalty
```

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public long maxScore(int[] nums, int x) {
        int n = nums.length;
        long[] score = new long[2];         // score for even and odd
        int curr = nums[0] & 1;             // Parity identifier 0: even 1: odd
        long seqSum = 0;                    // Sum of consecutive series of the same parity
        long ans = 0;
        score[curr] = nums[0];
        score[1 - curr] = nums[0] - x;
        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            if (i < n && (nums[i] & 1) == curr) {
                // if same parity, add to seqSum
                seqSum += nums[i];
            } else {
                // if parity changed, compare two scores
                score[curr] = Math.max(score[curr] + seqSum, score[1 - curr] + seqSum - x);
                ans = Math.max(ans, score[curr]);
                curr = 1 - curr;
                if (i < n) {
                    seqSum = nums[i];
                }
                
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
